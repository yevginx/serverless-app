# Frontend
This is a frontend powered by React.js, Vite, Amplify Libraries, and MUI.

## Local development
You can start a local server by the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Note that you must set `.env` file properly to use some of the features. To reduce mocking the AWS services, we recommend you first deploy a development environment to your AWS account, and refer to the resources in the environment from your local frontend.

`VITE_BACKEND_API_URL` is the only variable set by default. It is a endpoint for the main backend API. If you run backend API locally (see [backend/README.md](./../backend/README.md) for the detail), the default value (localhost:3001) will work. If you want to directly call the API you deployed to AWS, you can set the value from the stack output `BackendApiBackendApiUrl`.

You should additionally set Cognito configuration (`VITE_USER_POOL*` and `VITE_AWS_REGION`). These values can also obtained from the stack outputs.

```ini
VITE_BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_USER_POOL_ID=ap-northeast-1_NXDyxxxxx #AuthUserPoolId value
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=6gukdf98g88j9ngxxxxxxx # AuthUserPoolClientId value
VITE_AWS_REGION=ap-northeast-1 #the AWS region you deployed the app
```
